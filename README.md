[CyberCard](https://medo64.com/cybercard/)
==========================================

This USB device will show up on your system as a serial device and allow for a
fully isolated serial communication with CyberPower UPS devices that have support
for RMCARD202/RMCARD205 interface.

It was inspired with [Jeff Mayes Serial Interface](https://www.jmayes.com/cyberpower-backup-serial-protocol-and-interface/)
and wouldn't be possible without his extensive research.

Tested devices:
* OR500LCDRM1U
* OR700LCDRM1U
